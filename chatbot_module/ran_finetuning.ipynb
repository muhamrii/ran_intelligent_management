    "\n",
    "This notebook guides you through the process of fine-tuning a language model specifically for RAN (Radio Access Network) knowledge graph queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "- **Knowledge Graph**: 273 tables, 5,584 columns, 4M+ relationships\n",
    "- **Goal**: Create a domain-specific model that understands RAN terminology\n",
    "- **Process**: Data generation → Model training → Evaluation → Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Neo4j database with RAN knowledge graph\n",
    "- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)\n",
    "- GPU recommended for faster training"
